Comunitar.io, a boutique civic tech studio whose solutions address inefficient and opaque government, has officially opened its doors.

The company offers a wide range of expertise, including:
* geospatial analysis
* data visualization and mapping
* participatory mapping and data collection
* open data practices
* machine learning/deep learning
* data management
* urban development
* web platforms

Comunitar.io is guided by the principles of civically responsible technology - i.e., tech that is transparent and understandable to the people that it affects - and the coproduction of services - the idea that the users of a service should have the greatest hand in deciding how that service should be provided.

Inquiries can be made to CTO [Edgar Lemus](mailto:edgar@comunitar.io).

### Projects Overlay

To set what image links appear in the overlay menu edit `_data/projects.yaml`. Use the following format to set the URL, title, image and project status for as many links as you'd like. If you set `completed` to `false` like `completed: false`, it won't be clickable until you set it true like `completed: true`
